# Wireless-Power-Transfer
Create a wireless power transfer transmitter and emitter PCB using Altium Designer.

Model 1: Uses 555 timer to oscillate at resonance frequency of LC circuit to transmit power via magnetic resonance coupling.

Model 2: Uses PLL feedback system to auto oscillate at resonance frequency of LC circuit to transmit power via magnetic resonance coupling.

Model 1 Transmitter:
